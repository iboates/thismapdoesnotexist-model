# thismapdoesnotexist-model
Trained StyleGAN2 Model for generating 256px OpenStreetMap lookalikes

## Model

The model is too big for Github, so you can download it from my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1phVKU_pJ4q-rTUzAlaG6JX48ZIi4WYls/view?usp=sharing).

## Use

The model is a Pickled Python object, exported using Pickle protocol 4. The easiest way to use it is by uploading it to your own copy of the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16IGcod_0sQaDnQg9vhH0DkJi6yR3Rnb0) (also found in this repo).

You can then generate new maps or morphing videos between two different maps using seeds as shown in the notebook.
